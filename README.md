## What is this?
The Stock Market Analyzer is a compact program that allows for the analysis of different stocks and equities in real time. It was created with Python and its libraries, and allowed me to view and analyze the stocks in my personal portfolio through different charts and analytical graphs. You can view and use the project, as well as the different stocks in my portfolio, in the Google Colaboratory environment through the link above!

## Why?
In the beginning of 2021, I fell in love with the stock market and cryptocurrencies. Being able to invest my money in hopes of creating an 'effortless' second income stream was fascinating to me, and I loved the idea of being able to own tiny fractions of the companies I loved. With what started as a want to invest long-term, eventually became the want to try swing-trading, which is what inspired this program. Being able to analyze and track stocks as they move over different periods of time can allow the trader to make a calculated guess to where the stock may go, and I wanted to try to see these strategies, and the mathematics behind them, for myself.
