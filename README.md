## What is this?
The Stock Market Analyzer is a compact program that allows for the analysis of different stocks and equities in real time. It was created with Python and its libraries, and allowed me to view and analyze the stocks in my personal portfolio through different charts and analytical graphs. You can view and use the project, as well as the different stocks in my portfolio, in the Google Colaboratory environment through the link above!
